# Grammar

As with any programming language, Erminia has its own grammar and syntax rules.
The grammar is defined using Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) notation, which provides
a formal way to describe the structure of the language. The following sections outline
the main components of the Erminia grammar, including keywords, symbols, and the overall
EBNF grammar definition.
