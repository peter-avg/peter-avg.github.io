# Hello World! ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is **Petros (Peter) Avgerinos** and I am a MSc student at **Imperial College London**,
studying Applied Computational Science and Engineering. My undergrad degree was a 5 year
diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the **National Technical University of Athens (NTUA)**.
After graduating from NTUA in 2024, I joined the ENP Group at the Institute of Communication and Computer Systems (ICCS)
as a research associate, working on a variety of projects related to the responsible development and deployment of trustworthy AI systems.

## Research Interests

Among other things, I am currently particularly drawn to the use of Compilers and  Domain
Specific Languages (DSLs) for modelling and simulating real-world complex systems.
I am also very much interested in the use of these technologies for reaching Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

I am currently involved in a personal research project that aims to create an expressive 
DSL to efficiently allow for the interpretation of Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) images 
by humans and LLMs. You can find more about this on the [Erminia](ermnia.md) project page.
